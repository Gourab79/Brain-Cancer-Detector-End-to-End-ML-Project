##Brain-Cancer-Detector-End-to-End-ML-Project
This is my project on Brain Cancer Type Detection.
In this project I have used a dataset from kaggle.(link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedsorour1/mri-for-brain-tumor-with-bounding-boxes)
I used ANN and CNN architecture to develop my model. It has a accuracy of 75% on Val Data. I will be working to increase it upto 95% atleast.
The saved model is also uploaded in tyhe repository.
Its a End to End ML Engineering and Science Project where I used multiple technologies like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, MLOps, Data Science, Python Programming.
Hope u like this.
